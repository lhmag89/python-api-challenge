# python-api-challenge
This is a project to analyze weather and geographical data. It also gathers to data to find hotels near cities that are deemed ideal vacation spots by user.

## Technologies
Python, Jupyter, Pandas, Text Editor, Matplotlib, hvplot.pandas, requests, geoapify, openweather api, geoviews, cartopy, pprint, numpy, time, scipy.stats, citipy

## Installation Guide
Install the necessary tools. This includes generating api_keys for openweather and geoapify and putting them in the api_keys.py file. Run the file using Jupyter Notebook. Be sure that the .ipynb file is in the correct relative location to the data folder and .csv as required by the script.

## Usage
Run the scripts to generate a set of cities in WeatherPy.ipynb. Generate plots and analyze the data. City data is exported to csv. Copy that csv to the folder in VacationPy/output_data folder. Run the VacationPy.ipynb to read the csv. filter the city data by conditionals to narrow the table and look for hotels within 10000 meters of the city.
